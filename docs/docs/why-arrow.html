    # Why Apache Arrow?

    The core uchimata library accepts only data that are in the [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) IPC data format.

    ## Why?

    We've encountered several file formats used to store 3D coordinates of
    chromatin bins. Some come from proteomics tools (such as `PDB` or `CIF`),
    others are very general data file formats (e.g., `CVS`, `TSV`, `XYZ`). Few
    tools define their own formats: `nucle3d`, `3dg`, or
    [g3d](https://g3d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html). At their core, however,
    all these formats store 3 floating-point numbers (xyz coordinates) and some
    other columns (e.g., chromosome or genomic coordinate). Storing such
    information in formats that are based on delimiter-separated text files is
    often error prone and leads to incompatibility issues down the line.

    [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) is a standard for storing columnar
    data in memory and on disk. It is much more widespread, which allows us to
    leverage libraries and tools developed outside of computational biology. As a
    standard data format, Arrow integrates much more seamlessly with other data
    structures commonly used in data science. For example, it is very easy to
    [convert to/from numpy arrays](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/numpy.html)
    using the Python `pyarrow` library. Similarly [with
    pandas](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/pandas.html).

    ## Converting to Arrow

    To produce Arrow files from Python, we recommend consulting the Python Arrow
    Cookbook [example for writing Arrow to
    disk](https://arrow.apache.org/cookbook/py/io.html#saving-arrow-arrays-to-disk)

    We provide also provide a script (written in JS, using
    [deno](https://docs.deno.com)) for converting some of the above-mentioned file
    formats to `.arrow` files.
